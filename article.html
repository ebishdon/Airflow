                <p>Reduce the use of vehicles: Vehicles are one of the major contributors to air pollution. To reduce the amount of emissions from vehicles, individuals can use public transportation, walk, bike, or carpool instead of driving alone.
                    <br><br>Use clean energy: Switching to clean energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power can significantly reduce emissions from power plants, which are another major contributor to air pollution. Reduce energy consumption:
                    Energy conservation can help reduce the amount of emissions from power plants. This can be achieved by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using natural light instead of artificial
                    light. <br><br>Avoid burning waste and crops: Burning waste and crops can release harmful pollutants into the air. Instead, dispose of waste properly and use other methods for clearing crops, such as plowing or composting. Promote
                    sustainable development: Encouraging sustainable development practices such as green building design, land-use planning, and sustainable agriculture can help reduce air pollution. Use air purifiers and masks: Air purifiers and masks
                    can help protect individuals from harmful pollutants, especially during periods of high pollution. <br><br>Enforce regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies can enforce regulations on industries, transportation, and other sources
                    of pollution to reduce emissions and protect public health. By taking these preventive measures, we can help reduce air pollution and create a cleaner and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.
