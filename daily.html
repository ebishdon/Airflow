                <p>Date: 27th March 2023 Overall Air Quality Index (AQI): 215 (Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) AQI: 266 (Very Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 10 (PM 10) AQI: 187 (Unhealthy).
                    <br><br>The air quality in Delhi continues to remain poor with an overall AQI of 215, which falls in the "Unhealthy" category. The primary pollutant contributing to this poor air quality is PM 2.5, which has an AQI of 266, indicating
                    a "Very Unhealthy" level of air pollution. The PM 10 AQI is also high at 187, which is in the "Unhealthy" category.<br><br>People are advised to take precautions such as wearing a mask while outdoors, avoiding outdoor physical activity,
                    and limiting their exposure to outdoor air. Those with respiratory problems, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution and should take extra
                    precautions. <br><br>Authorities are continuing their efforts to reduce air pollution levels in Delhi through measures such as restricting industrial activity, controlling vehicular emissions, and promoting the use of public transport.
                    However, the public is also urged to take responsibility for reducing their own contributions to air pollution, such as by reducing the use of private vehicles and practicing eco-friendly habits.
