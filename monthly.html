                <p>Month: March 2023 Overall Air Quality Index (AQI) Range: 147 - 273 (Unhealthy - Very Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) Range: 94 - 280 µg/m³ (Moderate - Very Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 10 (PM 10) Range: 57 - 191 µg/m³ (Moderate
                    - Unhealthy).
                    <br><br>The air quality in Delhi during March 2023 remained mostly in the "Unhealthy" to "Very Unhealthy" range, with an overall AQI range of 147 to 273. The primary pollutant contributing to this poor air quality was PM 2.5, which
                    ranged from "Moderate" to "Very Unhealthy" levels throughout the month. The PM 10 levels also remained mostly in the "Moderate" to "Unhealthy" range. <br><br>Authorities continued their efforts to reduce air pollution levels in Delhi
                    during the month, with measures such as restricting industrial activity, controlling vehicular emissions, and promoting the use of public transport. However, despite these efforts, the air quality remained poor for much of the month.
                    <br><br>People were advised to take precautions to protect their health, such as wearing a mask while outdoors, avoiding outdoor physical activity, and limiting their exposure to outdoor air. Those with respiratory problems, such as
                    asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution and were advised to take extra precautions. Overall, the month of March 2023 saw poor air quality in Delhi,
                    with authorities and individuals urged to continue efforts to reduce air pollution and protect public health.
