                <p>Week: March 21-27, 2023 Overall Air Quality Index (AQI) Range: 161 - 238 (Unhealthy - Very Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) Range: 112 - 260 µg/m³ (Unhealthy - Very Unhealthy) Particulate Matter 10 (PM 10) Range: 74 - 187 µg/m³
                    (Moderate - Unhealthy) <br><br>The air quality in Delhi during the week of March 21-27, 2023 remained mostly in the "Unhealthy" to "Very Unhealthy" range, with an overall AQI range of 161 to 238. The primary pollutant contributing
                    to this poor air quality was PM 2.5, which ranged from "Unhealthy" to "Very Unhealthy" levels throughout the week. The PM 10 levels also remained mostly in the "Moderate" to "Unhealthy" range. <br><br>Authorities continued their efforts
                    to reduce air pollution levels in Delhi during the week, with measures such as restricting industrial activity, controlling vehicular emissions, and promoting the use of public transport. However, despite these efforts, the air quality
                    remained poor for much of the week. <br><br>People were advised to take precautions to protect their health, such as wearing a mask while outdoors, avoiding outdoor physical activity, and limiting their exposure to outdoor air. Those
                    with respiratory problems, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution and were advised to take extra precautions. Overall, the week of March
                    21-27, 2023 saw poor air quality in Delhi, with authorities and individuals urged to continue efforts to reduce air pollution and protect public health.
